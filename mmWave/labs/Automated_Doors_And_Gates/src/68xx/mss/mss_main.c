/** @mainpage Millimeter Wave (mmw) Demo for XWR68XX
 * [TOC]
 *  @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 *  @image html toplevel.png
 *
 *  The millimeter wave demo shows some of the capabilities of the XWR68xx SoC
 *  using the drivers in the mmWave SDK (Software Development Kit).
 *  It allows user to specify the chirping profile and displays the detected
 *  objects and other information in real-time.
 *
 *  Following is a high level description of the features of this demo:
 *  - Be able to specify desired chirping profile through command line interface (CLI)
 *    on a UART port or through the TI Gallery App - **mmWave Demo Visualizer** -
 *    that allows user to provide a variety of profile configurations via the UART input port
 *    and displays the streamed detected output from another UART port in real-time,
 *    as seen in picture above.
 *  - Some sample profile configurations have been provided in the demo directory that can be
 *    used with CLI directly or via **mmWave Demo Visualizer** under following directory:
 *    @verbatim mmw/profiles @endverbatim
 *  - Do 1D, 2D, CFAR, Azimuth and Elevation processing and stream out velocity
 *    and three spatial coordinates (x,y,z) of the detected objects in real-time.
 *    The demo can also be configured to do 2D only detection (velocity and x,y coordinates).
 *  - Various display options besides object detection like azimuth heat map and
 *    Doppler-range heat map.
 *
 *  @section limit Limitations
 *  - Because of UART speed limit (< 1 Mbps), the frame time is more restrictive.
 *    For example, for the azimuth and Doppler heat maps for 256 FFT range and
 *    16 point FFT Doppler, it takes about 200 ms to transmit.
 *  - For most boards, a range bias of few centimeters has been observed. User can estimate
 *    the range bias on their board and correct using the calibration procedure
 *    described in @ref Calibration_section.
 *
 *  @section systemFlow System Execution Flow
 *  The millimeter wave demo runs on R4F (MSS) and DSP(DSS). Following diagram shows the system
 *  execution flow
 *
 *  @image html system_flow.png "System Execution Flow"
 *
 *  @section tasks Software Tasks
 *    The demo consists of the following (SYSBIOS) tasks:
 *
 *    **MSS**
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_initTask. This task is created/launched by @ref main and is a
 *      one-time active task whose main functionality is to initialize drivers (\<driver\>_init),
 *      MMWave module (MMWave_init), DPM module (DPM_init), open UART and data
 *      path related drivers (ADCBUF), and create/launch the following tasks
 *      (the @ref CLI_task is launched indirectly by calling @ref CLI_open).
 *    - @ref CLI_task. This command line interface task provides a simplified 'shell' interface
 *      which allows the configuration of the BSS via the mmWave interface (MMWave_config).
 *      It parses input CLI configuration commands like chirp profile and GUI configuration.
 *      When sensor start CLI command is parsed, all actions related to starting sensor and
 *      starting the processing the data path are taken.
 *      When sensor stop CLI command is parsed, all actions related to stopping the sensor and
 *      stopping the processing of the data path are taken
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_mmWaveCtrlTask. This task is used to provide an execution
 *      context for the mmWave control, it calls in an endless loop the MMWave_execute API.
 *    - @ref mmwDemo_mssDPMTask. This task is used to provide an execution context for 
 *      DPM (Data Path Manager) execution, it calls in an endless loop. There is no DPC registered
 *      with DPM.
 *
 *    **DSS**
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_initTask. This task is created/launched by @ref main and is a
 *      one-time active task whose main functionality is to initialize drivers (\<driver\>_init),
 *      DPM module (DPM_init), data path related drivers (EDMA, HWA), and
 *      create/launch the following tasks.
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_DPC_ObjectDetection_dpmTask. This task is used to provide an execution
 *      context for DPM (Data Path Manager) execution, it calls in an endless loop
 *      the DPM_execute API. In this context, all of the registered object detection
 *      DPC (Data Path Chain) APIs like configuration, control and execute will
 *      take place. In this task. When the DPC's execute API produces the detected objects and other
 *      results, they are reported to MSS where they are transmitted out of the UART port for display 
 *      using the visualizer.
 *
 *   @section datapath Data Path
 *   @image html datapath_overall.png "Top Level Data Path Processing Chain"
 *   \n
 *   \n
 *   @image html datapath_overall_timing.png "Top Level Data Path Timing"
 *
 *   The data path processing consists of taking ADC samples as input and producing
 *   detected objects (point-cloud and other information) to be shipped out of
 *   UART port to the PC. The algorithm processing is realized using
 *   the DPM registered Object Detection DPC. The details of the processing in DPC
 *   can be seen from the following doxygen documentation:
 *   **Chirp processing DPC(objdetrangehwa)**
 *   @verbatim
      ti/datapath/dpc/objectdetection/objdetrangehwa/docs/doxygen/html/index.html
     @endverbatim
 *   **inter frame processing DPC(objdetdsp)**
 *   @verbatim
      ti/datapath/dpc/objectdetection/objdetdsp/docs/doxygen/html/index.html
     @endverbatim
 *
 *  @section output Output information sent to host
 *      @subsection output_general Output Packet
 *      Output packets with the detection information are sent out every frame
 *      through the UART. Each packet consists of the header @ref MmwDemo_output_message_header_t
 *      and the number of TLV items containing various data information with
 *      types enumerated in @ref MmwDemo_output_message_type_e. The numerical values
 *      of the types can be found in @ref mmw_output.h. Each TLV
 *      item consists of type, length (@ref MmwDemo_output_message_tl_t) and payload information.
 *      The structure of the output packet is illustrated in the following figure.
 *      Since the length of the packet depends on the number of detected objects
 *      it can vary from frame to frame. The end of the packet is padded so that
 *      the total packet length is always multiple of 32 Bytes.
 *
 *      @image html output_packet_uart.png "Output packet structure sent to UART"
 *
 *      The following subsections describe the structure of each TLV.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv1 List of detected objects
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_DETECTED_POINTS)
 *
 *       Length: (Number of detected objects) x (size of @ref DPIF_PointCloudCartesian_t)
 *
 *       Value: Array of detected objects. The information of each detected object
 *       is as per the structure @ref DPIF_PointCloudCartesian_t. When the number of
 *       detected objects is zero, this TLV item is not sent. The maximum number of
 *       objects that can be detected in a sub-frame/frame is @ref DPC_OBJDET_MAX_NUM_OBJECTS.
 *
 *       The orientation of x,y and z axes relative to the sensor is as per the
 *       following figure.
 *
 *        @image html coordinate_geometry.png "Coordinate Geometry"
 *
 *       The whole detected objects TLV structure is illustrated in figure below.
 *
 *       @image html detected_objects_tlv.png "Detected objects TLV"
 *
 *      @subsection tlv2 Range profile
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_RANGE_PROFILE)
 *
 *       Length: (Range FFT size) x (size of uint16_t)
 *
 *       Value: Array of profile points at 0th Doppler (stationary objects).
 *       The points represent the sum of log2 magnitudes of received antennas
 *       expressed in Q9 format.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv3 Noise floor profile
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_NOISE_PROFILE)
 *
 *       Length: (Range FFT size) x (size of uint16_t)
 *
 *       Value: This is the same format as range profile but the profile
 *       is at the maximum Doppler bin (maximum speed
 *       objects). In general for stationary scene, there would be no objects or clutter at
 *       maximum speed so the range profile at such speed represents the
 *       receiver noise floor.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv4 Azimuth static heatmap
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_AZIMUT_STATIC_HEAT_MAP)
 *
 *       Length: (Range FFT size) x (Number of virtual antennas) (size of @ref cmplx16ImRe_t_)
 *
 *       Value: Array @ref DPU_AoAProcHWA_HW_Resources::azimuthStaticHeatMap. The antenna data
 *       are complex symbols, with imaginary first and real second in the following order:\n
 *       @verbatim
             Imag(ant 0, range 0), Real(ant 0, range 0),...,Imag(ant N-1, range 0),Real(ant N-1, range 0)
             ...
             Imag(ant 0, range R-1), Real(ant 0, range R-1),...,Imag(ant N-1, range R-1),Real(ant N-1, range R-1)
         @endverbatim
 *       Based on this data the static azimuth heat map is constructed by the GUI
 *       running on the host.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv5 Range/Doppler heatmap
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_RANGE_DOPPLER_HEAT_MAP)
 *
 *       Length: (Range FFT size) x (Doppler FFT size) (size of uint16_t)
 *
 *       Value: Detection matrix @ref DPIF_DetMatrix::data.
 *       The order is : \n
 *       @verbatim
            X(range bin 0, Doppler bin 0),...,X(range bin 0, Doppler bin D-1),
            ...
            X(range bin R-1, Doppler bin 0),...,X(range bin R-1, Doppler bin D-1)
         @endverbatim
 *
 *      @subsection tlv6 Stats information
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_STATS )
 *
 *       Length: (size of @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t)
 *
 *       Value: Timing information as per @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t.
 *       See timing diagram below related to the stats.
 *
 *      @image html processing_timing.png "Processing timing"
 *
 *       Note:
 *       -#  The @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::interChirpProcessingMargin is not
 *           computed (it is always set to 0). This is because there is no CPU involvement
 *           in the 1D processing (only HWA and EDMA are involved), and it is not possible to
 *           know how much margin is there in chirp processing without CPU being notified
 *           at every chirp when processing begins (chirp event) and when the HWA-EDMA
 *           computation ends. The CPU is intentionally kept free during 1D processing
 *           because a real application may use this time for doing some post-processing
 *           algorithm execution.
 *       -#  While the
 *           @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::interFrameProcessingTime reported
 *           will be of the current sub-frame/frame,
 *           the @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::interFrameProcessingMargin and
 *           @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::transmitOutputTime
 *           will be of the previous sub-frame (of the same
 *           @ref MmwDemo_output_message_header_t::subFrameNumber as that of the
 *           current sub-frame) or of the previous frame.
 *       -#  The @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::interFrameProcessingMargin excludes
 *           the UART transmission time (available as
 *           @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::transmitOutputTime). This is done
 *           intentionally to inform the user of a genuine inter-frame processing margin
 *           without being influenced by a slow transport like UART, this transport time
 *           can be significantly longer for example when streaming out debug information like
 *           heat maps. Also, in a real product deployment, higher speed interfaces (e.g LVDS)
 *           are likely to be used instead of UART. User can calculate the margin
 *           that includes transport overhead (say to determine the max frame rate
 *           that a particular demo configuration will allow) using the stats
 *           because they also contain the UART transmission time.
 *
 *      The CLI command \"guMonitor\" specifies which TLV element will
 *      be sent out within the output packet. The arguments of the CLI command are stored
 *      in the structure @ref MmwDemo_GuiMonSel_t.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv7 Side information of detected objects
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_DETECTED_POINTS_SIDE_INFO)
 *
 *       Length: (Number of detected objects) x (size of @ref DPIF_PointCloudSideInfo_t)
 *
 *       Value: Array of detected objects side information. The side information
 *       of each detected object is as per the structure @ref DPIF_PointCloudSideInfo_t).
 *       When the number of detected objects is zero, this TLV item is not sent.
 *
 *  @section Calibration_section Range Bias and Rx Channel Gain/Phase Measurement and Compensation
 *
 *     Because of imperfections in antenna layouts on the board, RF delays in SOC, etc,
 *     there is need to calibrate the sensor to compensate for bias in the range estimation and
 *     receive channel gain and phase imperfections. The following figure illustrates
 *     the calibration procedure.
 *
 *     @anchor Figure_calibration_ladder_diagram
 *     @image html calibration_ladder_diagram.png "Calibration procedure ladder diagram"
 *
 *      The calibration procedure includes the following steps:
 *     -# Set a strong target like corner reflector at the distance of X meter
 *     (X less than 50 cm is not recommended) at boresight.
 *     -# Set the following command
 *     in the configuration profile in .../profiles/profile_calibration.cfg,
 *     to reflect the position X as follows:
 *     @verbatim
       measureRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase 1 X D
       @endverbatim
 *     where D (in meters) is the distance of window around X where the peak will be searched.
 *     The purpose of the search window is to allow the test environment from not being overly constrained
 *     say because it may not be possible to clear it of all reflectors that may be stronger than the one used
 *     for calibration. The window size is recommended to be at least the distance equivalent of a few range bins.
 *     One range bin for the calibration profile (profile_calibration.cfg) is about 5 cm.
 *     The first argument "1" is to enable the measurement. The stated configuration
 *     profile (.cfg) must be used otherwise the calibration may not work as expected
 *     (this profile ensures all transmit and receive antennas are engaged among
 *     other things needed for calibration).
 *     -# Start the sensor with the configuration file.
 *     -# In the configuration file, the measurement is enabled because of which
 *     the DPC will be configured to perform the measurement and generate
 *     the measurement result (@ref DPU_AoAProc_compRxChannelBiasCfg_t) in its
 *     result structure (@ref DPC_ObjectDetection_ExecuteResult_t::compRxChanBiasMeasurement),
 *     the measurement results are written out on the CLI port (@ref MmwDemo_measurementResultOutput)
 *     in the format below:
 *     @verbatim
       compRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase <rangeBias> <Re(0,0)> <Im(0,0)> <Re(0,1)> <Im(0,1)> ... <Re(0,R-1)> <Im(0,R-1)> <Re(1,0)> <Im(1,0)> ... <Re(T-1,R-1)> <Im(T-1,R-1)>
       @endverbatim
       For details of how DPC performs the measurement, see the DPC documentation.
 *     -# The command printed out on the CLI now can be copied and pasted in any
 *     configuration file for correction purposes. This configuration will be
 *     passed to the DPC for the purpose  of applying compensation during angle
 *     computation, the details of this can be seen in the DPC documentation.
 *     If compensation is not desired,
 *     the following command should be given
 *     @verbatim
       compRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase 0.0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
       @endverbatim
 *     Above sets the range bias to 0 and
 *     the phase coefficients to unity so that there is no correction. Note
 *     the two commands must always be given in any configuration file, typically
 *     the measure commmand will be disabled when the correction command is the
 *     desired one.
 *
 *  @section LVDSStreamingNotes Streaming data over LVDS
 *
 *    The LVDS streaming feature enables the streaming of HW data (a combination of ADC/CP/CQ data)
 *    and/or user specific SW data through LVDS interface.
 *    The streaming is done mostly by the CBUFF and EDMA peripherals with minimal CPU intervention.
 *    The streaming is configured through the @ref MmwDemo_LvdsStreamCfg_t CLI command which
 *    allows control of HSI header, enable/disable of HW and SW data and data format choice for the HW data.
 *    The choices for data formats for HW data are:
 *      - @ref MMW_DEMO_LVDS_STREAM_CFG_DATAFMT_DISABLED
 *      - @ref MMW_DEMO_LVDS_STREAM_CFG_DATAFMT_ADC
 *      - @ref MMW_DEMO_LVDS_STREAM_CFG_DATAFMT_CP_ADC_CQ
 *
 *    In order to see the high-level data format details corresponding to the above
 *    data format configurations, refer to the corresponding slides in ti\drivers\cbuff\docs\CBUFF_Transfers.pptx
 *
 *    Note:
 *    -# Only single-chirp formats are allowed, multi-chirp is not supported.
 *    -# Currently this device does not support analog monitoring and is rejected at
 *       CLI level if any of the analog monitoring configurations are enabled.
 *       However, the implementation code is there to make it easier to enable
 *       functionality in a future release when device may start supporting the monitoring.
 *       Because of this limitation, the @ref MMW_DEMO_LVDS_STREAM_CFG_DATAFMT_CP_ADC_CQ
 *       format is also rejected during CLI configuration.
 *
 *    When HW data LVDS streaming is enabled, the ADC/CP/CQ data is streamed per
 *    chirp on every chirp event. When SW data
 *    streaming is enabled, it is streamed during inter-frame period after the
 *    list of detected objects for that frame is computed.
 *    The SW data streamed every frame/sub-frame is composed of the following in time:
 *    -# HSI header (@ref HSIHeader_t): refer to HSI module for details.
 *    -# User data header: @ref MmwDemo_LVDSUserDataHeader
 *    -# User data payloads:
 *      -# Point-cloud information as a list : @ref DPIF_PointCloudCartesian_t x number of detected objects
 *      -# Point-cloud side information as a list : @ref DPIF_PointCloudSideInfo_t x number of detected objects
 *
 *    The format of the SW data streamed is shown in the following figure:
 *
 *      @image html lvds_sw_data_format.png "LVDS SW Data format"
 *
 *    Note:
 *    -# When number of objects detected in frame/sub-frame is 0, there is no
 *       transmission beyond the user data header.
 *    -# For HW data, the inter-chirp duration should be sufficient to stream out the desired amount
 *       of data. For example, if the HW data-format is ADC and HSI header is enabled,
 *       then the total amount of data generated per chirp
 *       is:\n
 *        (numAdcSamples * numRxChannels * 4 (size of complex sample) +
 *       52 [sizeof(HSIDataCardHeader_t) + sizeof(HSISDKHeader_t)] )
 *       rounded up to multiples of 256 [=sizeof(HSIHeader_t)] bytes.\n
 *       The chirp time Tc in us = idle time + ramp end time in the profile configuration.
 *       For n-lane LVDS with each lane at a maximum of B Mbps,\n
 *       maximum number of bytes that can be send per chirp = Tc * n * B / 8 which
 *       should be greater than the total amount of data generated per chirp i.e\n
 *       Tc * n * B / 8 >= round-up(numAdcSamples * numRxChannels * 4 + 52, 256). \n
 *       E.g if n = 2, B = 600 Mbps, idle time = 7 us, ramp end time = 44 us, numAdcSamples = 512,
 *       numRxChannels = 4, then 7650 >= 8448 is violated so this configuration will not work.
 *       If the idle-time is doubled in the above example, then we have 8700 > 8448, so
 *       this configuration will work.
 *    -# For SW data, the number of bytes to transmit each sub-frame/frame is:\n
 *       52 [sizeof(HSIDataCardHeader_t) + sizeof(HSISDKHeader_t)] +
 *       sizeof(MmwDemo_LVDSUserDataHeader_t) [=8] + \n
 *       number of detected objects (Nd) * { sizeof(DPIF_PointCloudCartesian_t) [=16] + sizeof(DPIF_PointCloudSideInfo_t) [=4] }
 *       rounded up to multiples of 256 [=sizeof(HSIHeader_t)] bytes.\n
 *       or X = round-up(60 + Nd * 20, 256). So the time to transmit this data will be \n
 *       X * 8 / (n*B) us. The maximum number of objects (Ndmax) that can be
 *       detected is defined in the DPC (@ref DPC_OBJDET_MAX_NUM_OBJECTS). So if
 *       Ndmax = 500, then time to transmit SW data is 68 us. Because we parallelize
 *       this transmission with the much slower UART transmission, and because UART transmission
 *       is also sending at least the same amount of information as the LVDS, the
 *       LVDS transmission time will not add any burdens on the processing budget
 *       beyond the overhead of reconfiguring and activating the CBUFF session
 *       (this overhead is likely bigger than the time to transmit).
 *    -# The total amount of data to be transmitted in a HW or SW packet must be greater than the
 *       minimum required by CBUFF, which is 64 bytes or 32 CBUFF Units (this is the definition
 *       CBUFF_MIN_TRANSFER_SIZE_CBUFF_UNITS in the CBUFF driver implementation).
 *       If this threshold condition is violated, the CBUFF driver will return an error during
 *       configuration and the demo will generate a fatal exception as a result.
 *       When HSI header is enabled, the total transfer size is ensured to be at least
 *       256 bytes, which satisfies the minimum. If HSI header is disabled, for the HW session,
 *       this means that numAdcSamples * numRxChannels * 4 >= 64. Although mmwavelink
 *       allows minimum number of ADC samples to be 2, the demo is supported
 *       for numAdcSamples >= 64. So HSI header is not required to be enabled for HW only case.
 *       But if SW session is enabled, without the HSI header, the bytes in each
 *       packet will be 8 + Nd * 20. So for frames/sub-frames where Nd < 3, the
 *       demo will generate exception. Therefore HSI header must be enabled if SW is enabled,
 *       this is checked in the CLI command validation.
 *
 *   @subsection lvdsImpl Implementation Notes
 *
 *    -# The LVDS implementation is mostly present in mmw_lvds_stream.h and
 *      mmw_lvds_stream.c with calls in mss_main.c. Additionally HSI
 *      clock initialization is done at first time sensor start using @ref MmwDemo_mssSetHsiClk.
 *    -# EDMA channel resources for CBUFF/LVDS are in the global resource file
 *      (mmw_res.h, see @ref resourceAlloc) along with other EDMA resource allocation.
 *      The user data header and two user payloads are configured as three user buffers in the CBUFF driver.
 *      Hence SW allocation for EDMA provides for three sets of EDMA resources as seen in
 *      the SW part (swSessionEDMAChannelTable[.]) of @ref MmwDemo_LVDSStream_EDMAInit.
 *      The maximum number of HW EDMA resources are needed for the
 *      data-format @ref MMW_DEMO_LVDS_STREAM_CFG_DATAFMT_CP_ADC_CQ,
 *      which as seen in the corresponding slide in ti\drivers\cbuff\docs\CBUFF_Transfers.pptx is
 *      12 channels (+ shadows) including the 1st special CBUFF EDMA event channel
 *      which CBUFF IP generates to the EDMA, hence the HW part
 *      (hwwSessionEDMAChannelTable[.]) of @ref MmwDemo_LVDSStream_EDMAInit
 *      has 11 table entries.
 *    -# Although the CBUFF driver is configured for two sessions (hw and sw),
 *      at any time only one can be active. So depending on the LVDS CLI configuration
 *      and whether advanced frame or not, there is logic to activate/deactivate
 *      HW and SW sessions as necessary.
 *    -# The CBUFF session (HW/SW) configure-create and delete
 *      depends on whether or not re-configuration is required after the
 *      first time configuration.
 *      -# For HW session, re-configuration is done during sub-frame switching to
 *        re-configure for the next sub-frame but when there is no advanced frame
 *        (number of sub-frames = 1), the HW configuration does not need to
 *        change so HW session does not need to be re-created.
 *      -# For SW session, even though the user buffer start addresses and sizes of
 *        headers remains same, the number of detected objects which determines the
 *        sizes of some user buffers changes from one sub-frame/frame to another sub-frame/frame.
 *        Therefore SW session needs to be recreated every sub-frame/frame.
 *    -# User may modify the application software to transmit different information than point-cloud
 *      in the SW data e.g radar cube data (output of range DPU). However the CBUFF also has
 *      a maximum link list entry size limit of 0x3FFF CBUFF units or 32766 bytes.
 *      This means it is the limit for each user buffer entry
 *      [there are maximum of 3 entries -1st used for user data header, 2nd
 *      for point-cloud and 3rd for point-cloud side information]. During session creation,
 *      if this limit is exceeded, the CBUFF will return an error (and demo will in turn
 *      generate an exception). A single physical buffer of say size 50000 bytes
 *      may be split across two user buffers by providing one user buffer with
 *      (address, size) = (start address, 25000) and 2nd user buffer with
 *      (address, size) = (start address + 25000, 25000), beyond
 *      this two (or three if user data header is also replaced) limit,
 *      the user will need to create and activate (and wait for completion)
 *      the SW session multiple times to accomplish the transmission.
 *
 *    The following figure shows a timing diagram for the LVDS streaming
 *    (the figure is not to scale as actual durations will vary based on configuration).
 *
 *      @image html lvdstiming.png "LVDS timing diagram"
 *
 *  @section bypassCLI How to bypass CLI
 *
 *    Re-implement the file mmw_cli.c as follows:
 *
 *    -# @ref MmwDemo_CLIInit should just create a task with input taskPriority.
 *       Lets say the task is called "MmwDemo_sensorConfig_task".
 *    -# All other functions are not needed
 *    -# Implement the MmwDemo_sensorConfig_task as follows:
 *       - Fill gMmwMssMCB.cfg.openCfg
 *       - Fill gMmwMssMCB.cfg.ctrlCfg
 *       - Add profiles and chirps using @ref MMWave_addProfile and @ref MMWave_addChirp functions
 *       - Call @ref MmwDemo_CfgUpdate for every offset in @ref configStoreOffsets
 *         (MMWDEMO_xxx_OFFSET in mmw_mss.h)
 *       - Fill gMmwMssMCB.objDetCommonCfg.preStartCommonCfg
 *       - Call @ref MmwDemo_openSensor
 *       - Call @ref MmwDemo_configSensor
 *       - Call @ref MmwDemo_startSensor (One can use helper function
 *         @ref MmwDemo_isAllCfgInPendingState to know if all dynamic config was provided)
 *
 *  @section resourceAlloc Hardware Resource Allocation
 *    The object detection DPCs(objdetrangehwa and objdetdsp) need to configure the DPUs 
 *    hardware resources (HWA, EDMA etc). The resource partitioning is shown to be in
 *    the ownership of the demo. This is to illustrate the general
 *    case of resource allocation across DPCs and/or demo's own
 *    processing that is post-DPC processing. This partitioning
 *    can be seen in the mmw_res.h file. This file is passed as a compiler command line
 *    define @verbatim "--define=APP_RESOURCE_FILE="<ti/demo/xwr68xx/mmw/mmw_res.h>" @endverbatim 
 *    in mmw_mss.mak and mmw_dss.mak when building the DPC sources as part of building the demo application and
 *    is referred in object detection DPC sources where needed as
 *    @verbatim #include APP_RESOURCE_FILE @endverbatim
 *
 *  @section demoDesignNotes Design Notes
 *  
 *  Due to the limitation of DPM local queue size, for certain DPM functions such as @ref DPM_start, @ref DPM_stop and
 *  some of the DPC control through @ref DPM_ioctl, semaphores are used to sync between calling task and function
 *  @ref MmwDemo_DPC_ObjectDetection_reportFxn. So that it won't cause DPM crash because of running out of
 *  DPM local queues. The following diagram demonstrates the example calling flow for blocking @ref DPM_ioctl() function call.
 *  Non-blocking @ref DPM_ioctl is also shown for comparison.
 *
 *  @image html dpm_ioctl_handling.png "DPM_ioctl calling flow"
 *
 *  There are DPM report functions on both MSS and DSS for the same DPM_Report. However the sequence is not guaranteed between the
 *  two cores.
 *
 *  @section memoryUsage Memory Usage
 *  @subsection memUsageSummary Memory usage summary
 *    The table below shows the usage of various memories available on the device across
 *    the demo application and other SDK components. The table is generated using the demo's
 *    map file and applying some mapping rules to it to generate a condensed summary.
 *    The numeric values shown here represent bytes.
