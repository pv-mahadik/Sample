            * [Overhead 3D People Counting](../labs/People_Counting/overhead_3d_people_counting/docs/overhead_3d_people_counting_user_guide.html)
                * Added support for fine motion detection
        
            * [Vital Signs With People Tracking](../labs/Vital_Signs/Vital_Signs_With_People_Tracking/docs/vital_signs_with_people_tracking_user_guide.html) (renamed from People Counting with Vital Signs)
                * Renamed for clarity on functionality
                * Now supports a higher framerate
                
            * [High Accuracy Level Sensing](../labs/Level_Sensing/docs/high_accuracy_user_guide.html)
                * Minor improvements to configuration files
                
                
    ## Packaging Updates

# Version 4.10.1
    
    ## New and Updated Features
        
        
        ### Antennas
            * IWR6843LEVM **New**
            
            
        ### Labs
            * Out of Box Demo
                * Added support for IWR6843LEVM  
            * People Counting Labs
                * Added IWR6843LEVM to lab/evm support matrix
            * People Counting with Vital Signs
                * Now supports the AoPEVM in standalone mode
            
        
    ## Bug Fixes
        * Fixed broken links
        * Fixed issue in People Counting Visualizer where default values would no longer fill in correctly due to Toolbox version number having an extra digits
        * Fixed the cfg provided for Fall Detection
        
        
    ## Packaging Updates
        * Dramatically reduced package size through video compression and removal of unused resources

# Version 4.10.0
    

    ## New and Updated Features


        ### Labs
            The following Labs have been updated in this toolbox:
            
            * Fundamentals
                * New lab category that contains labs that have basic modifications to existing content
                * Labs in Fundamentals are made to serve as reference as to how specific features can be added to a mmWave Application
            
            * People Counting with Vital Signs
                * New lab which demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors for Vital Signs Detection on a target from a wall mount position
                * Leverages the tracker to localize the target location

            * People Counting with WiFi
                * Allows you to combine People Counting using mmWave with SimpleLink WiFi in order to transmit radar data over the air
                * Comes with premade binaries to simplify the flashing process

            * Hard Coded Config
                * Updated to use the newer methodology for Hard Coding a Configuration
